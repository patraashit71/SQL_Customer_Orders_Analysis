# 📊 SQL Skills Demonstration Project

- This project focuses on demonstrating my SQL skills using a virtual supply chain company database.
- I have covered a wide range of SQL skills to analyze the dataset.
- In this project, I am acting as a data analyst for a supply chain company, addressing queries posed by my manager and cross-functional teams.
- You can also use the codes to learn or review my work.
- To do so first run the codes in the classic models.sql file and thereafter using the codes in the Supplychain_Analysis.sql file.

Our database, `classicmodels`, contains the following tables:

* 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 `customers`
* 📦 `products`
* 📝 `orders`
* 👨‍💼 `employees`
* 💵 `payments`
* 📋 `orderdetails`
* 🏷️ `productline`

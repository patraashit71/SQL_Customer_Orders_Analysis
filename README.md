# SQL_Customer_Orders_Analysis
This project focuses on demonstrating my SQL skills with the help of a customer and orders database. 
I have tried to cover every skill that I have in SQL to analyse the dataset.
In this project I am acting as a data analyst for a supply chain company to solve queries asked by my manager and cross-functional teams.
Our database classicmodels contains the below tables:
•	customers
•	products
•	orders
•	employees
•	payments
•	orderdetails
•	productline
